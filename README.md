MPhil Digital Humanities project titled 'The Language of Leadership: A Digital Humanities Approach to Analysing Emotional Resonance and Linguistic Complexity in Political Speech'

This repository contains the code, data, and analytical documentation for the project The Language of Leadership: Emotional Resonance and Rhetoric in Political Speech. The study explores how computational methods can deepen our understanding of political rhetoric, with a particular focus on emotional resonance and thematic patterns in speeches by American political leaders.

Project Overview

This research sits at the intersection of Digital Humanities, Political Science, and Computer Science. By employing NLP tools, such as RoBERTa and Co-occurrence Network Analysis, the project investigates the linguistic patterns, emotional intensity, and thematic networks within (2020-2024) Republican and Democratic rhetoric. The analysis seeks to uncover how political leaders invoke shared values, appeal to voter psychology, and construct rhetorical strategies that mobilise collective identities.

Research Questions
	1.	How do emotional and thematic patterns in political speeches differ across party lines?
	2.	What linguistic strategies resonate most with audiences, and how do these vary in framing and sentiment?
	3.	Can computational tools capture the nuance and complexity of emotional resonance in political language?

Key Components

	•	Methodology:
 
	•	Emotional Analysis: Utilising RoBERTa for emotional classification and co-occurrence analysis to map relationships between emotionally charged terms.
 
	•	Thematic Network Analysis: Employing co-occurrence network analysis to identify clusters of terms and their rhetorical framing within speeches.
 
	•	Comparative Analysis: Examining Republican and Democratic rhetoric, emphasising gaps in existing literature on left-leaning discourse.
 
	•	Tools and Technologies:
 
	•	Python-based NLP libraries (Hugging Face Transformers, NetworkX, spaCy)
 
	•	Data visualisation tools (Matplotlib)
 
	•	Key Findings:
 
	•	Thematic and emotional differences between Republican and Democratic leaders.
 
	•	Insights into the emotional framing strategies that resonate with audiences and mobilise support.
 
	•	Limitations of current NLP tools in capturing nuanced political contexts.

Significance

This project demonstrates the value of combining computational methods with traditional humanities inquiry, contributing to the growing field of Digital Humanities. It also highlights how interdisciplinary approaches can enhance our understanding of political rhetoric and its societal impact.
